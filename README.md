Welcome to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIh706ZRmN0">Wreckage Systems</a> stream from <a href="https://65daysofstatic.com">65LABS</a>. All music you hear is being generated live, endlessly.<br>

<a href="https://youtu.be/Q9wwNmd78Ik">Wreckage Systems</a> is a live broadcast of new, endless <a href="https://65daysofstatic.com">65daysofstatic</a> music. It is generated live on a computer and broadcast to the internet. It takes as its source hours of new recordings we made during lockdown (and continue to make), it combines them using software that we wrote, and turns them into music.<br>

Wreckage Systems is what you will wake up to in the mornings and fall asleep to at night. It is your digital noise comrade. It is the end point of electronic musicians alienating themselves. It is the dark heart of a collapsing music industry. It is the cold, numbing embrace of data centres. It is audio anaesthetic to accompany your doom scrolling. It is the future without future. It is everywhere. All that is solid melts into air. It is weaponised ephemerality. It is 65daysofstatic stretched into a life time.

Wreckage Systems is open to everyone in cyberspace as both audio-only and video streams. But 65LABS cannot maintain this stream without your financial support. Please consider becoming a <a href="https://wreckage.systems">65LABS patron</a> today.<br>
